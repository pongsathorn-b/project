# Our Love Story — Project scaffold

This repository was scaffolded to create a clean, maintainable static-site structure.

## What's included
- `index.html` — entry point
- `assets/css/style.css` — styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — minimal JS to load `data/memories.json`
- `data/memories.json` — sample data

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser or serve with a static server. Example using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Next steps
- Move personal images to a private host or remove before publishing
- Add accessibility improvements and tests
- Add CI/CD to publish to GitHub Pages
